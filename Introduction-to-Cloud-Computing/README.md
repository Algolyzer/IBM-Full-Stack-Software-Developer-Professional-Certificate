# IBM Cloud Object Storage Project

Welcome to the IBM Cloud Object Storage project! This project aims to guide you through creating an Object Storage instance on the IBM Cloud platform, setting up a bucket to store data, adding objects to the bucket, and sharing those objects.

## Project Overview

In this project, you will learn how to:
- Create an IBM Cloud Object Storage instance
- Set up a bucket to organize and store your data
- Add objects to the bucket, such as files and documents
- Share objects stored in the bucket using access policies

By the end of this project, you will have hands-on experience with IBM Cloud Object Storage and its features.

## Getting Started

To get started, make sure you have an IBM Cloud account. If you don't have one, you can sign up [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration).

## Project Steps

Follow these steps to complete the project:

1. **Create an Instance of IBM Cloud Object Storage:**
   - Log in to your IBM Cloud account and navigate to the [IBM Cloud Catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog).
   - Search for "Object Storage" and select the Lite plan.
   - Provide a name for your instance, accept the default resource group, and create the instance.

2. **Create a Bucket to Store Your Data:**
   - In the instance details, click on "Create bucket" to set up a storage container for your data.
   - Choose a name for the bucket and review the settings.
   - Confirm the creation of the bucket.

3. **Add Objects to Your Bucket:**
   - Access your bucket details and start uploading objects.
   - You can either drag and drop files or use the upload feature.
   - A variety of file types can be added, such as documents, images, and more.

4. **Share Objects in Your Bucket:**
   - Define access policies for your bucket to control who can access the stored objects.
   - You can set specific permissions for users and groups or even make certain objects public.
   - Obtain the public URL of shared objects for easy access.
